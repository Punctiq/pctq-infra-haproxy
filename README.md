# Punctiq HAProxy

> Custom HAProxy container built on Ubuntu 22.04, designed for use in secure, isolated environments as part of the Punctiq infrastructure stack.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository provides a Dockerized version of HAProxy tailored for Punctiq deployments. It ensures non-root execution, built-in health checks, and minimal dependencies to fit cleanly into CI/CD workflows and production environments.

The image is meant to serve as a base for internal or external load balancing in microservice or container-based architectures managed by Punctiq.
